# live.ecclesias.net streaming setup

This is a compilation of various open-source tools to enable an easy-to-use streaming setup on [live.ecclesias.net](https://live.ecclesias.net).

We looked at dozens of great projects here on github and other web resources to compile our needed tools. Below are some links you might findhelpful.

The lua-scripts listed below were created by us. Please feel free to use them, just note that the terms of the MIT license apply.

A huge thank you to the [Erzbistum Hamburg](https://www.erzbistum-hamburg.de/) and their great support. They made this possible and permittedus to publish it. We really appreciate their belief that public money (like church taxes) should be invested in public code! If you work for other religious organizations, please inform them about this [campaign](https://publiccode.eu/de/).
